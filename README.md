## Welcome to my Javascript based To-Do List application!

 This application is built for my UVU DGM 3760 course and the goal is to develop a To-Do List app that functions entirely off of Javascript. To see my live deployment of this project, click [here](https://dgm-todolist.netlify.app)

 Most of the [CSS styling](https://github.com/Mike-Dahle/todolist/blob/master/styles.css) is provided by my professor, but I have added my own CSS rules as needed.

 The basic layout of my [HTML](https://github.com/Mike-Dahle/todolist/blob/master/index.html) was also provided by my professor.

 But if you want to see where the real magic happens, go check out my Javascript code [here.](https://github.com/Mike-Dahle/todolist/blob/master/todolist.js)
